HHS Mobile App Development

By Eric Cheng and David McAllister


This app is designed to provide a mobile interface that works alongside a stable backend database structure to provide users with information about available books and their checkouts. Additionally, it implements a scanner API to allow users to checkout books with their phone cameras. Future features are in development.
