# MAD-2018
HHS Mobile App Development
*By Eric Cheng, David McAllister, and Lily Li*

Check out more details on our wiki: https://github.com/Eric-Cf/MAD-2018/wiki

This app is designed to provide a mobile interface that works alongside a stable backend database structure to provide users with information about available books, their holds, and their checkouts. Additionally, it implements a scanner API to allow users to checkout books with their phone cameras. The app was developed in conjunction with Homestead High School's library to ensure our app would be useful in a real world situation.

## Getting Started

Download Xcode to run the testing environment. You can view the code, but you need a developer account to sign the instance to run on your computer. 
Alternatively, you can download the app off of "TestFlight" onto your phone to run the app on your phone.

### Prerequisites

To view the code
```
-Mac OS
-XCode
```
To run the application on your computer
```
-Mac OS
-XCode
-Developer signing 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Key Features

* Robust backend relational database to store information
* Well commented database access code
* Checkout with your phone for ease of access
* Intelligent keyword search algorithm to look for books
* Hold system that lets you reserve a book to pick up later
* Customized map to identify book locations
* Bug reporting to enable continuous development
* Smart resource management to reduce database calls and memory leaks

## Deployment

This application is supported by a server side script, so any user just has to connect with their account (made with the library when they join the school)

## Built With

* MySQL server hosted with bluehost.com
* PHP access code hosted with bluehost.com
* Swift code for UI and implementation
* CocoaPods for library dependency management
