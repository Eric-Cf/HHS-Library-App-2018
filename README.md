This app is designed to provide a mobile interface that works alongside a stable backend database structure to provide users with information about available books, their holds, and their checkouts. Additionally, it implements a scanner API to allow users to checkout books with their phone cameras. 
Features:
-Robust backend relational database to store information
-Well commented database access code
-Checkout with your phone for ease of access
-Intelligent keyword search algorithm to look for books
-Hold system that lets you reserve a book to pick up later
-Customized map to identify book locations
-Bug reporting to enable continuous development
-Smart resource management to reduce database calls and memory leaks

## Getting Started

Download Xcode to run the testing environment. You can view the code, but you need a developer account to sign the instance to run on your computer. 
Alternatively, you can download the app off of "TestFlight" onto your phone to run the app on your phone.

### Prerequisites

To view the code
```
-Mac OS
-XCode
```
To run the application on your computer
```
-Mac OS
-XCode
-Developer signing 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
