-Well commented database access code
-Checkout with your phone for ease of access
-Intelligent keyword search algorithm to look for books
-Hold system that lets you reserve a book to pick up later
-Customized map to identify book locations
-Bug reporting to enable continuous development
-Smart resource management to reduce database calls and memory leaks
